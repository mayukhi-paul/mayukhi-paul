👋 Hello there! I'm Mayukhi, a passionate machine learning enthusiast and a technology aficionado currently pursuing a BTech in Information Technology. 🎓 In my 2nd year of studies, I'm immersing myself in the fascinating world of data and algorithms, exploring the limitless possibilities that machine learning offers. 🤖💡

Beyond my love for machine learning, I am also deeply intrigued by the revolutionary technology of blockchain. 🌐💎 I am actively expanding my knowledge in this area, eager to understand its potential applications and contribute to its development.

Research is another realm that captivates me. 🔍🔬 Exploring innovative ideas and working on exciting projects keeps me motivated and fuels my curiosity.

When I'm not diving into the realm of technology, you'll often find me lost in the world of music. 🎵🎶 Music brings me solace and inspiration, and I enjoy exploring various genres and discovering new artists.

Join me on this exhilarating journey as we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology, explore the depths of machine learning, delve into the potential of blockchain, and seek new horizons through research. Let's connect and collaborate! 🚀🌟
